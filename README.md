This project has a header file that has prototypes for 3 functions that are implemented in dca1d.c
There is the init1DCA function that created an array filled with 0's of a specified length
There is the set1DCA function that sets an element of the array at the given index to the given value >= 0
There is the display1DCA function that prints all the elements of the array separated by spaces and finishes by printing a new line
There is the main function, not prototyped in the header file, that runs all 3 functions for a simple test of the program

To run the program make sure you are in the base project directory, then type make in the terminal
