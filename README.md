# Project 1 - Part B

## Features Implemented
This program will simulate a 1D CA given certain starting conditions and a transition function

It requires command line input for 
- number of cells
- number of possible states for each cell
- a wrap flag to determine how edge cases are handled
- initial value of the cells
- number of steps to simulate


It will print the current state of the CA after each transition
## How to Execute the Program
To run the program make sure you are in the base project directory, 
type `make` in the terminal,
then type 

`./odca <numCells> <numStates> <wrap/nowrap> <initialState> <numSteps>`
